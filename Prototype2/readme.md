# Software

## Getting started:

- install UTFT in your Android IDE
- (optional) open memorysaver.h and disable all except SSD1289 to make the program 14kB smaller.
- open this sketch and send it to the Arduino Due using the programming port.

# Hardware

The Eagle schema is used as documentation of the hand-soldered rev2, but the pcb layout is just experimental.
